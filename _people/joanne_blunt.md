    title: SPOTLIGHT ON… TECHNICAL DIRECTING
    date: 2016-04-16
    quote: "The greatest part of TDing is of course opening night, when you’ve made some inevitable mistakes but fixed them with quick thinking so nobody noticed, had a hug from the director and producer and you head off home ready to do it all again the following evening."
