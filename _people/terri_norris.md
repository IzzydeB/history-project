Lots of acting roles from The a Importance of Being Ernest to one act play at The National Student Drama Festival in London in 1975. Edinburgh Festival review in 1976. Directed in one act play festival. I remember Hugh Simon was in the Buttery and missed his cue to come on stage in, I think "A Long Day's Journey into Night".
