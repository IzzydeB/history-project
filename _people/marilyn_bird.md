Along with the rest of the Mad Forest cast and crew, I helped to demolish the original proscenium arch stage in the summer of 1997, to make way for the fancy new studio space that allowed you to see right into the wings, no matter where you were sitting in the audience.

Marilyn gradutated from Birmingham School of Acting in 2006. She is now a full-time actor and voiceover artist. She also teaches improvisation.
