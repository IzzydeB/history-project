trivia:
  - quote: "Since this was the first English production outside London (the play premiered at the Royal Court in French in 1957) we wrote to Beckett (who did the English translation) in Paris inviting him to attend the Nottingham premiere. Sadly he did not reply, though of course he may have been that quiet gentleman with the puzzled frown at the back."
