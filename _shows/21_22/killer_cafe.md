Ever fantasied about a significant other conveiently 'disappearing' so you can avoid the loathsome formality of a breakup? For Freddie and Sky, the deaths of their partners could be their only escape from toxic know-it-alls and wannabe knights in shining armour. Conspiring in a quiet cafe - revenge is sweet, but coffee has never tasted so bitter...
