    quote: "Under the direction of Andrew Houghton and the production of Miguel Barrulas, the rapid-fire exchanges and repetition of phrases are brought to life as entertaining, almost rhythmic dialogue."

Emma is settling into her new job but her seemingly friendly Manager is eerily concerned with her workplace relationships. When Emma becomes romantically involved with a co-worker, her Managerâ€™s tough stance on the relationship systematically strips Emma of her dignity, individuality, and ultimately her sanity.

Told through a series of one-on-one meetings, Contractions explores corporate intrusiveness, compliance and just how far a woman will go to keep her job in a tough economic climate.
