The brain builds a narrative to steady us from moment to moment, but it is absolutely an illusion. There is no me, there is no you, and there is certainly no self.

1953 – Pioneering brain surgery for epilepsy leaves Henry unable to form new memories.  
1955 – During his autopsy Albert Einstein’s brain is stolen.  
The Present – Martha’s a neuropsychologist with a broken down marriage that has inspired her to make radically different choices.  

Inspired by true events, Incognito is an exhilarating exploration of what it means to be human and how what we remember shapes who we are.

I cannot tell you what we might be able to uncover. What I can tell you, is that there is a lot we still don’t know. Progress is a destination.
