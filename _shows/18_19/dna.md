Adam is gone, presumed dead. He was last seen on the edge of a deep, disused shaft, with a group of teenagers throwing stones at him. They may be guilty, but they have no intention of getting caught.

This is a black comedy that chillingly unfolds to demonstrate the power of group psychology and the extremes to which each member will go to protect themselves and their friends.
