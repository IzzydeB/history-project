"For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction"
– Third Law of motion. Isaac Newton. 1686.

Three individuals with little in common have gathered to tell you something. Something important to them, supposedly. But things are going wrong.

No matter how hard they try they can’t agree on a way to say it.

No matter how hard they try they can’t seem to do it right, the way they planned.

And no matter how hard they try:
Z can’t help but be a Tennyson poem,
X can’t help but be a Russian antihero,
and Y can’t help but be the world of L. Frank Baum.
