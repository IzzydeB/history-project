Laura Chandler believes that her husband Victor is having an affair with another woman, and tricks him into meeting her at a local “love” motel in order to catch him in the act. In doing so, she involves a huge range of characters, including a friend of questionable sexuality, a lascivious doctor, the owner of the Pussycat Motel, a very jealous Spanish man and his wife, and a drunken porter named Potts, who happens to be Victor Chandler’s doppelganger.
