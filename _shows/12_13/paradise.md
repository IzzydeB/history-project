    quote: >
      ‘Paradise’ is a remarkable piece of both physical and ensemble theatre. Taking place over the course of a day on
      the London Underground, the setting is a stark reminder of the many different people and events that simply pass
      us by during our everyday lives.

    quote: "A moderately entertaining mishmash of stories and anecdotes with mask work, a bendy bench and some nice guitar playing."
