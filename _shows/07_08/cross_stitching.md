    quote: "In the end, Cross Stitching is much more about two people attempting to sort out their feelings for one another than an individual's struggle with gender identity."

From the production team that brought you ‘After Miss Julie’, comes a new modern day love story embedded with twists and turns rendering it closer to Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde than Romeo and Juliet.

Richard and Thomas’ burgeoning romance is limited only by their feelings of inadequacy and embarrassment as their affection in everyday situations and scenarios garner the unwanted disgust of a predominantly heterosexual society. In this surrealist piece, the consequence of such unwanted attention is Richard’s decision to have a gender-reassignment operation and thus the introduction of his post-operational alter ego, Gail. Non-linear and surrealist in style, ‘Cross-Stitching’ is an offer of new writing which has gone through the rigours of the Donmar Warehouse, whilst serving up something genuinely fresh and original in its analysis of contemporary social acceptance and perception.
