"Then they separated us. We tried to say no, we applied for asylum as a couple. They say we don’t have any civil evidence that we are a couple. And we’re like “how can we show you any civil evidence if homosexuality is forbidden in my country?” 'This Is Who I Am' shares first-hand accounts from LGBT+ people about their experiences in their own country and on arrival in the UK, addressing the particular challenges they face going through the UK asylum system. 

Please be aware that accounts of state, sexual and homophobic violence are included.
