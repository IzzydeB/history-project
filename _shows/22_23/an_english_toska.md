    quote: "An interesting feature I was fond of was how the radio essentially had its own role to play. The radio is always playing, predominantly joyful carols that dichotomised Charlotte’s consistent despair, rendering her almost alien to the passing of time and outside world as she is unable to find happiness in ‘the most wonderful time of the year’."

Charlotte and Thomas are celebrating their first Christmas without their son, Alfred. The couple are struggling to cope with the loss of their child especially during this festive season. The play takes place in 1950s England, a time where communication and expressing emotions was not a cultural priority. The standards of Mid-Century, post-war England furthers the couple’s problems because they are not talking about their differing mourning processes or dealing with their grief together. The play is set over the course of a day from the morning of the 24th of December to midnight, when it officially becomes Christmas. Charlotte and Thomas are hosting a Christmas Eve meal for their friends: Nora and William. This joyous meal turns sour as the couple’s underlying tension is finally brought to the surface.
