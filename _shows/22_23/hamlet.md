    quote: "In fact, the direction of this performance really drew out the comedic elements of Shakespeare’s work in a fashion I haven’t seen before. Whether it was Hamlet giving his famous “Words, words, words!” line whilst tearing up a copy of Mr Grumpy, Claudius and Polonius shuffling into the audience as they spy on Hamlet (“Prithee, make way!”), or Ophelia being given advice in the form of a Florence Given book, we were kept laughing the whole way through."

> “Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.”

A death, a coronation, a ghost. A happily crowned Claudius sits on the throne with his new wife Gertrude. But when Hamlet’s father, the usurped King, appears to him as a spirit, wishing for Hamlet to avenge his death, a revenge plot is afoot. An exploration of life, death, love, and what it means to be alive – for better or for worse.
