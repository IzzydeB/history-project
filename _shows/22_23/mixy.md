Spicy, and not just the kebabs. Sizzling family politics, spilt cha, and sticky floors are the norm in this family-run Indian pub grill. After the patriarch’s passing, the business is set to pass to this central family, each with their own trepidations about who will run it next. Living above the bar & grill, the family jointly take it into their hands to continue Nanaji’s powerful legacy but only one has been deemed its true owner. 

Facing generational differences, intrinsic sexism, and constant assumptions of character; it’s only a question of when their truths will be exposed. Welcome to Nanaji’s Bar & Grill, renowned for its Indian mixed grill and scream-from-the-stairs soap opera drama.
