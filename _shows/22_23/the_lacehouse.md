Fresh From the Edinburgh Fringe, NNT Presents 'The Lacehouse'

Wanna see a real Greek Tragedy?

Three sisters. Three prized possessions. One crystal ball from a site that shall remain nameless. The night before their father’s funeral, three estranged sisters hold a seance to locate the most prized possession of their now deceased parents, immigrants from Cyprus who left their lives behind for the UK and all its promises. There’s just one problem - each sister is hiding what they truly want from the others. Where is the will? Who has the veil? And who else knows about the mysterious letter hidden somewhere in the house?

From dances with the dead to sibling rivalries, each sister must face their reckoning in the wake of those not long dead, and secrets that will refuse to stay buried…

A tragicomedy in one act.
