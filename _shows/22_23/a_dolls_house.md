A modern adaptation of a timeless classic. A Doll’s house explores one
woman’s escape from patriarchal oppression. When Nora’s life as she
knows it is brought into question on Christmas Day, Nora is forced to
make a choice that will affect her life as she knows it. Torvald and Nora
Helmer, who’ve had some financial struggles, are delighted because
Torvald has received a major promotion at work. But Nora, behind her

lightheartedness and occasionally juvenile behaviour- encouraged,
always, by her husband who calls her diminutive, vaguely insulting
names- is hiding a major secret. She borrowed a substantial sum of
money a few years ago to finance a trip to Italy to help Torvald recover
from a major illness. But now she is threatened to reveal the truth, and
this becomes increasingly problematic especially when it is discovered
that an illegal forgery is involved...
