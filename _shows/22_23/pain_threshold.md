What’s a life outside of pain? What’s the cost, and is it truly worth it? How are you meant to act when your ex is coming over in an hour and you haven’t done laundry in weeks?

Pain Threshold asks what the limit truly is – of love and of grief. Taking inspiration from queer punk gig-theatre, it explores a relationship breakdown between two people and their experiences of pain, big and small, through angry-camp covers of Ezra Furman.
