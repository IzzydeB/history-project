Secrets, lies and deception must all be revealed around the table. A dinner party to celebrate Robert’s promotion takes a nasty turn when Lucas’s antics are revealed. For what Robert and Darcy’s dinner party lacks in food, it makes up for in a drunken appetite for revelations. Will either one of the couples leave the table in one piece?
