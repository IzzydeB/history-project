David and Liam are just two housemates, best mates even, in their final year of university. They’ve been through thick and thin together, rugby wins and losses, bad dates and even worse dates, and the all-nighters that come after a forgotten deadline. But is that enough to sustain their friendship? 

After a new guy joins the rugby team, the boys are divided and difficult conversations are started, but never really finished. 

Initiation is an exploration of how two young men navigate a world that’s asking them to step up and how they choose to do so, if they try. Informed by responses from twenty men, this play is a work in progress designed to spark conversations about what allyship is in today’s society.
