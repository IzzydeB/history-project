'Conversations with an Asexual' is a raw and slightly too honest portrayal of discovering sexual identity. This story highlights the difficulties in not knowing who you are or where you fit in, or if you do fit in at all. The play follows A, the protagonist who ultimately is extremely confused, she’d never really noticed before that she felt differently to others but suddenly, she’s confronted with her own difference. Grasping to find someone or Something to help her understand herself better A forges new relationships and questions her old ones trying desperately to figure it all out, only to realise that that might not be possible.
