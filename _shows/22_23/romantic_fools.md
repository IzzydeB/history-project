Romantic Fools is “a comic vaudeville”, a revue of 12 two-character sketches 
following an Everyman and Everywoman as they explore the world of love, lust, 
dating and romance. Showing the influences of Monty Python, Saturday Night 
Live, Jules Feiffer, the Marx Brothers, and classic vaudeville comedy, these 
sketches vary widely in style, but they all celebrate the inherent farce of male/female relationships.
