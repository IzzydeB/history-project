Living in middle class London in the 1950s, Hester should be living a comfortable and fulfilling life. However, behind her façade of the perfect entertainer and homemaker, she suffers from crippling depression which drives her to try and take her own life. The play follows the 24-hour aftermath of this event, in which we learn her reason for resorting to this form of escape and see her learn to live on another day. Discussing themes of depression, love and the mundanity of survival, this timeless classic leaves the audience with a sense of catharsis and bitter-sweet hope.
