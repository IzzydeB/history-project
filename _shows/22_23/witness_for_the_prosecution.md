You have been summoned for Jury duty! The likeable Leonard Vole is on trial for the murder of a wealthy woman, Miss French, with defence barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts choosing to represent him. Unfortunately, Leonard's main alibi depends on the testimony of his shady wife, Romaine. As the audience is drawn through a series of puzzling revelations, reversals, and legal loopholes, we ask is Leonard truly guilty of foul play, or is it something more sinister? Written by British author Agatha Christie, delve into the immersive thriller case and see how the trial plays out.
