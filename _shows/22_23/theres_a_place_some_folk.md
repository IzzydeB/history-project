There's a place some folk call Hope. It's got a bit of a population problem. Sometimes, our states of mind, trying, waiting, hoping, grieving, can become so all-consuming that they feel like actual, physical places which our minds inhabit. So, what if they were? Leia was sharp-witted , defiant, shameless. She was good. After her sudden passing, her friends and family are forced to come to terms with their changed realities and broken hearts. They find themselves in an abstract world within their imagination, wherein their states of mind are represented by a physical island. Throughout this comedy-drama, those, who knew and loved Leida Rhodes, must explore these strange, other-worldly islands in order to reach conclusions about their own emotional states, as they learn how adjusting to life after grief can be impossibly painful, yet surprisingly beautiful, all at once.
