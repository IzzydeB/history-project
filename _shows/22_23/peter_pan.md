All children grow up... except for one. J.M. Barrie's spellbindingly classic tale 'Peter Pan' takes flight. When Peter Pan, leader of the lost boys, loses his shadow, headstrong Wendy helps him to reattach it. In return, she is invited to Neverland, where Tinker Bell, Tiger Lily and the vengeful captain hooks awaits. Exploring the possibilities and pain of growing up, a riot of magic, mischief, and make-believe ensues.
