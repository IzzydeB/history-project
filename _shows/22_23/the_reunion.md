We're all familiar with that stage in life, when it's our time to leave our friends and "fly the nest" to a new beginning. Have you fallen under the trap of saying 'friends forever?' to each other... But what if you're not meant to be friends forever? Have you ever considered the possibility that your friends and people you have met come in seasons? What if your so-called besties are not meant to be your besties? 'The Reunion' explores this possibility. A group of friends who have made a pact to reunite in 10 years, once they have explored the word, come to discover that maybe they're better off without each other, This story comprises real friendship struggles under the guise of light-hearted humour and sarcasm with the message of loving people for their moment. Is there any value in long-lasting friendships, or is outgrowing a friend inevitable?
