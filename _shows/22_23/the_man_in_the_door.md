Have you ever felt that grey cloud looming over you? Or ever felt like the world could come crashing down at any moment? Then perhaps you have a man in the door. We follow Michael’s journey through grief, trauma, and loneliness as he tries to rid himself of the ‘man in the door’. This story is about how a man deals with depression when his whole world comes apart around him. In a gripping story of inner conflict and self-doubt, we witness how a visit from the ‘man in the door’ can cause us to be trapped in the deadliest prison on earth...the mind.
