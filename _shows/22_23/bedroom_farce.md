Trevor and Susannah, whose marriage is on the rocks, inflict their miseries on
their nearest and dearest: three couples whose own relationships are tenuous at
best. The eldest couple, Delia and Ernest, are getting ready to go out for a meal
to celebrate their wedding anniversary; Malcolm and Kate, the youngest, are
about to host a housewarming party, to which the other two couples; Jan and
Nick and Susannah and Trevor, have been invited. At the last-minute, Nick hurts
his back and is unable to go.
Taking place sequentially in the three beleaguered couples' bedrooms during
one endless Saturday night of co-dependence and dysfunction, beds, tempers,
and domestic order are ruffled, leading all the players to a hilariously touching
epiphany.
