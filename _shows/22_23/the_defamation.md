    quote: "The Defamation convincingly and adeptly uses Shakespearean English throughout, and moreover, rhymes consistently from start to finish. (Yes, you read that right.) I can only imagine the effort it must have taken to achieve such a feat."

What happens when you die? And are you going up or down? For the women of The Defamation, it is a question they must ponder as they await trial in the courts of the afterlife. But something is rotten in this court. When Charity, a woman infamous on earth, arrives at the court, the corruption of the system is truly revealed, as the women crowd around her to push for a fair trial. Based on the characters of Shakespeareâ€™s legal dramas, The Defamation explores modern celebrity culture and what it means to be a woman scrutinised in court and the press alike.
