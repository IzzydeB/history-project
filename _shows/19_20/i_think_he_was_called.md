    quote: "The cast and crew have done a spectacular job of bringing a new take to ‘As You Like It’. ‘I Think He Was Called Rosalind’ is a truly exciting way to experience Shakespeare in a modern context.  I would urge anyone to head over to the NNT YouTube channel and watch it."

Based on ‘As You Like It’ by William Shakespeare, ‘I think He was called Rosalind’ follows the events in the Forest of Arden as perceived by Fae, a mysterious creature who lives there. Fae watches as Rosalind, disguised as man, flees the court with Celia and builds a new life in the forest unknowing that her lover Orlando is there in exile. Watching, narrating and striving to understand the events of the humans’ lives, Fae takes a new perspective on the havoc humans wreck on each other and their environment in Shakespeare’s classic tale of love, confusion, and trickery. This is ‘As You Like It’ like you’ve never seen it before.
