    quote: "Indeed, what is lasting about ‘Reverie’ is its environmental theme. The morality of its characters is not an abstract discussion, rather a direct challenge to its audience. Most pertinent and moving is the sensation of guilt and inaction which floods the play. The world beyond Todd and Reagan is dying, there are sirens blaring and a mermaid shouting, power is running out and it is all paralyzingly overwhelming."

In the far future, on a base deep beneath the Atlantic Ocean, a mysterious creature has broken on board and picked off the crew one by one. The two surviving crew members want nothing more than to escape, but have lost all contact with the outside world. Running low on power and supplies, all that can help them is the base’s malfunctioning computer - which has started talking to them. Their situation is only worsened by the presence of a strange woman promising the destruction of all mankind. Worst of all, neither of the survivors can be sure if anything around them is real, or simply their steady descent into insanity...
