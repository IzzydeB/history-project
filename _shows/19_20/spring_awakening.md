    quote: "I applaud all involved with the two productions for dealing with such difficult topics so sensitively. ‘SPRING’ and ‘AWAKENING’ make up a very moving piece of digital theatre that raises timeless points on teenage sexuality. Despite the difficult circumstances the cast and crew have had to adapt to, their resilience paid off."

This double bill was performed as part of the virtual UPLOAD Festival 

‘SPRING’ tells the story of a group of teenagers, as they rebel against their controlling parents, struggle to navigate love, and deal with tragedies around them; they begin to discover their individuality, their sexuality, and ultimately their freedom of choice.

‘AWAKENING’ explores the dangers of forced ignorance and deception when it comes to the lives of young people; a group of schoolchildren trying to navigate the unknowns of adolescence leads to disastrous consequences.
