    quote: "If anything, TL;DR works better as an online piece than it would have on stage; it is clearly written with a tailored approach in mind. It is an opening piece that truly celebrates the NNT’s online season with a controversial punch."

His search takes him further and further into the annals of the internet, isolation and personal oblivion.
